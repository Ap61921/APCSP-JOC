	<h3>PHS: 2023 - 2024</h3>
           <p>The school year has had a lots of ups and downs but has been overall positive. Classes are going well but a strike is planned to happen during AP testing which will officially make everyone unhappy, the kids, parents, teachers, and adminostrators. Hopefull something is done to invrease the budget for teacher's salaries to keep the teachers we have and get new ones too.</p>
